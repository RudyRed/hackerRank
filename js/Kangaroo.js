// You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are
// given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction
// (i.e, toward positive infinity).
//
// The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
// The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
// You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location as part
// of the show.
//
// Complete the function kangaroo which takes starting location and speed of both
// kangaroos as input, and return  or appropriately. Can you determine if the
// kangaroos will ever land at the same location at the same time? The two
// kangaroos must land at the same location after making the same number of jumps.
//
// Input Format
//
// A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values
// of , , , and .
//
// Constraints
//
// Output Format
//
// Print YES if they can land on the same location at the same time; otherwise, print NO.
//
// Note: The two kangaroos must land at the same location after making the same number of jumps.
//
// Sample Input 0
//
// 0 3 4 2
// Sample Output 0
//
// YES
// Explanation 0
//
// The two kangaroos jump through the following sequence of locations:
//
// image
//
// From the image, it is clear that the kangaroos meet at the same location
// (number  on the number line) after same number of jumps ( jumps), and we print YES.
//
// Sample Input 1
//
// 0 2 5 3
// Sample Output 1
//
// NO
// Explanation 1
//
// The second kangaroo has a starting location that is ahead (further to the right)
// of the first kangaroo's starting location (i.e., ). Because the second kangaroo
// moves at a faster rate (meaning ) and is already ahead of the first kangaroo, the
// first kangaroo will never be able to catch up. Thus, we print NO.
